        <h3>The Library</h3>
        <p>
        Our latest app is the ultimate resource for people wanting to improve their coding and IT skills. With the help of an app, you have access to the ultimate library of 
        technology-related books. Check these books out, and you're on the fast-track to becoming a coding master.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Apps</h3>
        <p>
          Check out our first app--<a href="https://whoenig44.github.io/bootcamp-project-1/">GLO (Grocery List Organizer)</a>. This app 
          allows you to create lists of the items you normally buy at various stores. Before you make a trip to that store, you can 
          check off items that you're running low on. You can also also add items that you need to buy this time that aren't on 
          your list of regular purchases
        </p>
        <p>
          Another app, <a href="https://github.com/whoenig44/syntax-surfers-project-2">Health Is Wealth!</a>, is a great resource for users who want to track how certain behaviors or foods affect their health. Users determine which behaviors
          they want to track, and then they record how they are feeling each day. A number of graphs allow users to see how these things are related. You are what you eat, and Health Is 
          Wealth! helps you see how what you eat affects how you feel.

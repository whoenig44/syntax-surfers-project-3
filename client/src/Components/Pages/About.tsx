        <h3>Health Is Wealth!</h3>
        <p>
          Our latest app makes it easier for you to track whether certain behaviors are affecting your health. Because every 
          body is different, you choose the behaviors that you feel may be affecting you. This could be eating certain ingredients, 
          like gluten or dairy, or it could be other behaviors like exercising or getting at least 8 hours of sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you decide what behaviors you want to track, Health Is Wealth! provides a simple interface so that you can record whether 
          you engaged in that behavior each day. You also log how you feel each day, so that you can see if there is a correlation between 
          the behaviors you're tracking and how you feel.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Apps</h3>
        <p>
          Check out our first app--<a href="https://whoenig44.github.io/bootcamp-project-1/">GLO (Grocery List Organizer)</a>. This app 
          allows you to create lists of the items you normally buy at various stores. Before you make a trip to that store, you can 
          check off items that you're running low on. You can also also add items that you need to buy this time that aren't on 
          your list of regular purchases
        </p>
